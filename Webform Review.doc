		<h1>Code Review: Language - C#</h1>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Code organization and structure:</h2>
			<p>The code is organized into a namespace and a single class that inherits from the System.Web.UI.Page class. The class name "ManageClinic" reflects the purpose of the page, but could be further improved for clarity. The code appears to be properly structured and grouped by related functionality, with appropriate methods and comments describing their purpose.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Best practices adherence:</h2>
			<p>The code adheres to several best practices, including the use of proper variable naming, the use of parameterized SQL queries to avoid SQL injection attacks, and the use of a separate data access layer (myDAL) to encapsulate database interactions. However, there is a lack of error handling in certain cases, and some parts of the code (such as the SQL queries) are not properly optimized for performance.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Readability and maintainability:</h2>
			<p>The code is generally easy to read and understand, with well-named variables, methods, and comments that describe their purpose. However, there are some areas where the code could be made more readable, such as by using if-else chains instead of nested if-else statements.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Robustness and error handling:</h2>
			<p>The code has several areas where it lacks proper error handling, such as when a null or empty result set is returned from the database. In addition, the code does not handle exceptions in a consistent or proper manner, and there are some points where the program could crash due to unexpected input or conditions.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Scalability and performance:</h2>
			<p>The code has several areas where it could be improved for performance, such as by using parameter sniffing or stored procedures to optimize SQL queries. In addition, the lack of error handling and exception handling could cause issues with scalability and result in poor program performance.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Coding Practices and Design Patterns:</h2>
			<p>The code follows some coding practices and design patterns, such as the use of an object-relational mapping layer to abstract database interactions. However, there are areas where the code could be improved for better consistency and efficiency, such as by using LINQ or other modern coding practices.</p>
		</div>

			<h2>Line by Line code review:</h2>
			<pre>
				<code>
Line 1 - 6: Import statements for the required libraries
Line 8 - 26: Class declaration with a method to load the data onto the grid on page load (Page_Load) and also a method to handle the deletion of rows in the grid (DeleteDoctor_Click).
Suggested improvement: The code could benefit from better error handling, validation of input, and use of parameterized SQL queries in methods that access the database.

Line 28 - 49: A method (LoadGrid) to load the data onto the grid based on Category (Doctor, Patient, or OtherStaff) and SearchQuery as parameters. This method calls the relevant method in myDAL to retrieve the data and binds it to the grid.
Suggested improvement: The use of a switch statement instead of an if-else chain could make the code more readable and efficient. The method could also benefit from better error handling and validation of input.

Line 51 - 64: A method to handle the search button event (Search_btn) that again calls the LoadGrid method with the appropriate parameters based on the selected radio button.
Suggested improvement: This method could be consolidated with the RadioButton_CheckedChanged method to avoid duplication of code.

Line 66 - 77: A method to handle the radio button event (RadioButton_CheckedChanged) based on which button is selected. This method also calls the LoadGrid method with the appropriate parameters.
Suggested improvement: Consolidation with the Search_btn method to remove code duplication.

Line 79 - 98: A method to handle the grid command event and retrieve the row data based on which radio button is selected and display it in a separate div on the page (SelectCommand).
Suggested improvement: Better handling of errors and input validation. It is also unclear why the method is named SelectCommand, which does not reflect its purpose.
